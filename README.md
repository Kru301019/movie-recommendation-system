Movie Recommendation System Project Description for GitHub
Project Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on the selected movie's similarity to others. It employs machine learning techniques and is deployed using Streamlit, making it interactive and user-friendly. The system leverages content-based filtering, where movie descriptions, genres, keywords, cast, and crew are analyzed to recommend similar movies.

Key Features
Content-Based Recommendation

The system uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to analyze movie features like genres, keywords, and cast to generate a similarity score matrix using cosine similarity.
Interactive Web Application

The recommendation system is deployed as a web app using Streamlit.
Users can select a movie from the dropdown menu to get personalized movie recommendations.
Poster Integration

The app fetches movie posters using the TMDB API, providing a visually appealing experience.
Efficient Recommendation

The system returns the top 5 most similar movies based on their features, excluding the selected movie.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, nltk
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Web App Deployment: Streamlit
Data Handling: pandas, numpy
API: TMDB API for fetching movie posters
Data: TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset
How It Works
Data Preprocessing

The dataset is cleaned by removing missing values and duplicate records.
Key movie features like genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview are extracted and combined into a single feature called tags.
Stopwords are removed for better text analysis.
TF-IDF Vectorization

A TF-IDF vectorizer is used to convert text data (tags) into numerical form, capturing the importance of each word in the dataset.
Cosine Similarity Matrix

The similarity between movies is computed using cosine similarity, which measures how closely the feature vectors of two movies align.
Recommendation Logic

Based on the selected movie, the system identifies the most similar movies using the similarity matrix.
Movie IDs are retrieved, and corresponding posters are fetched via the TMDB API.
Streamlit App

Users interact with the system through an intuitive dropdown menu to select a movie.
Recommendations are displayed with movie posters in a grid format.
Deployment Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open the app in a browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).
Demo
Users can:

Select a movie from the dropdown menu.
View 5 recommended movies with their posters.
Files and Directories
app.py: Contains the Streamlit app code.
similarity.pkl: Precomputed cosine similarity matrix.
movies_dict.pkl: Serialized movie data with features.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.
Future Enhancements
Add hybrid recommendation capabilities (content + collaborative filtering).
Enhance UI/UX of the app with more interactivity.
Integrate features like trailers and ratings for better recommendations.
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful approach to building a recommendation system while showcasing essential skills in machine learning, API integration, and web app deployment.
